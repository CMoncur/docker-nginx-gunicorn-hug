# docker-gunicorn-hug

Boilerplate for a docker image containing Docker, uWSGI, and Hug

## Getting started

Clone repository, navigate to directory where repository was cloned, then:

```
$ docker-compose up --build
```

Once output from uWSGI appears on the console, navigate to `localhost:8000`. A `hello world` message should be visible!
